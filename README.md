# Example Code -- Don't Use As Is
Example Caldera Forms processor to add custom validation rules to a form. This is example code for a tutorial: https://calderawp.com/doc/creating-custom-validation-processor-caldera-forms/

If forking this repo to make your own field validator, at least search and replace "test_validator" with a unique slug, and change the function `test_validator_cf_validator_is_valid` to do the kind of validation you need for a field value.
